# Progressive-Item-Speedup-Addon
This is a small addon that speeds up your world when knitting and doing similar things.
The longer you continuously craft, the faster you and the world around you get. This is to make crafting large amounts of items less tedious while still keeping the game balanced.

Roughly saves 50-65% of the (real-)time when crafting progressive items in one go. Be careful though, as e.g. enemies will also move faster!

Have fun!
